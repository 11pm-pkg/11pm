# HPM Package Manager #

HPM is an experimental package manager that I'm writing to easier facilitate
a personal Linux distribution. It's currently in the "what am I doing and how
do I do it" phase, where I take fifty attempts to start the project before
finally settling on a language and setup.

The implementation that got the furthest is written in Go. It hasn't gotten
very far yet. It can be found at https://gitlab.com/hpm/hpm, along with a
fair amount of info about what I want HPM to be.
