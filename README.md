# 11pm - Independent Package Manager #

11pm is an experimental package manager that I'm writing to easier facilitate
a personal Linux distribution. It's currently in the "what am I doing and how
do I do it" phase, where I take fifty attempts to start the project before
finally settling on a language and setup.

There is a fairly fleshed out roadmap (albeit without any dates) on a Trello
board at https://trello.com/b/WNIUaPej/11pm. You can find some documentation
on the wiki at https://github.com/11pm-pkg/11pm/wiki.
